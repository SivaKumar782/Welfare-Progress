  "Mitigating reputational risk is a key service we offer to our clients. Having worked extensively with animal advocacy organisations, we know the value of transparent communication of progress to mitigate reputational risks. The focus of animal advocacy groups is shifting quickly from policy adoption to policy enforcement and accountability, with global and local groups now launching questionnaires, surveys, trackers, and benchmarking tools. Filling out numerous cage-free egg progress surveys and questionnaires is overwhelming and time consuming for food businesses. It has become a never-ending task. While these surveys all seek to evaluate progress on the same initiative – cage-free eggs- they often use different metrics and cover different geographies. We’ve received a lot of feedback from the food industry that there is a need for a more centralised and streamlined reporting process.":"Mitigating reputational risk is a key service we offer to our clients.
