              Having worked extensively with animal advocacy organisations,
              we know the value of transparent communication of progress to mitigate reputational risks.
              The focus of animal advocacy groups is shifting quickly from policy adoption to policy enforcement and
              accountability,
              with global and local groups now launching questionnaires, surveys, trackers,
              and benchmarking tools.Filling out numerous cage-free egg progress surveys and questionnaires is
              overwhelming and time consuming for food businesses. It has become a never-ending task.
              While these surveys all seek to evaluate progress on the same initiative – cage-free eggs-
              they often use different metrics and cover different geographies. We’ve received
              a lot of feedback from the food industry that there is a need for a more centralised and streamlined
              reporting
              process.
              In order to support our clients and the food industry as a whole, we’ve taken this feedback and developed
              this
              platform,
              which aims to make this process more efficient and uniform.We hope this platform offers a solution to food

            We believe that reporting on progress is an essential step to make sure cage-free policies are followed. We
            have been working with companies in Latin America and launched reports to share more about companies’
            progress in the region. We will be doing the same in Asia. We are happy to see a new platform that will
            centralize questionnaires and reporting from companies, so we decided to start sharing this new
            questionnaire with companies. We’ll create regional reports using the public data available on
             <a href="#">animalwelfare.org </a>
