            to policy enforcement and accountability, with global and local groups now launching questionnaires,

            While these surveys all seek to evaluate progress on the same initiative – cage-free eggs- they often use
            different metrics and cover different geographies. We’ve received a lot of feedback from the food industry
            that there is a need for a more centralised and streamlined reporting process.</p>

              <q>Mercy For Animals supports the comprehensive, uniform cage-free egg progress reporting enabled
                by WelfareProgress.com. As we encourage transparency on corporate animal welfare goals through
                initiatives like Monitor de Iniciativas Corporativas por los Animales, this tool streamlines
                reporting expectations and formats to help the world transition away from the caging of laying
                hens.</q>
